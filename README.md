# Hospitals Alternative for the Overflow of Patients with Shipping Containers

## Problem

Lack of space in the hospitals, this creates an overflow of patients that as we’ve seen in pandemics as the covid-19, some hospitals were short of space making that patients had to experiences uncomfortable environments where their health is impaired.

## Goal   

Give the hospitals a fast and efficient prototype alternative to them has the opportunity of expanding their areas with these shipping containers using them like an ICU (intensive care units) giving them the ability to treat more patients in the best conditions.

## Operation

These containers are going to have all the equipment that the hospitals need in an ICU (intensive care unit). This equipment is different in each design, in the page we have three different designs each with different materials and different use cases, the first prototype is Alpha, this model has all the materials that the patient needs, this is a more private environment since it’s just one bed and here the patient could have visits. The second prototype is Blue this can include from one to two beds, the goal is to attend to more patients, and being able to help them giving them the best condition, Prototype Red is a more complex environment where it's going to be ready for surgeries.

###  Security Mesures
The security measures that a hospital needs to take into consideration with process that keep the security off the patients and their environment be a safe one.

#### Personal Security
These are the measurements that the hospital takes to take care of the patients without putting in danger the workers or the other patients.

#### Respect for Privacy
This is the "medic-patient" information, but more than that this is all the data of the hospital save from fires, accidents or vandalism.

#### External Security
Give the patients peace where they feel in a secure environment without feeling any threat in their wellness.

#### Dangerous Material
All the materials that are used in the hospitals have to go to a toxic waste basket that goes to a specific recycling process.

#### Risk of Infections
These are the securities and permits that the different departments and workers of the hospitals plan in order to keep the safety of the patients and to maintain the sanity of the hospital in function.
