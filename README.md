###  Security Mesures
1. Personal Security
This are the measurements that the hospital takes to take care of the patients without putting in danger the workers or the other patients.

2. Respect for Privacy
This is the "medic patient" information, but more than that these is all the data of the hospital saved from fires, accidents or vandalism.
